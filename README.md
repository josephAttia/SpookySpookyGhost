# SpookySpookyGhost


## Inspiration
What inspired me to build this project is both my brother, who is in love with ghosts, and Halloween as a whole!

## What it does
It's just a ghost who is floating. Included are shaders, animation, and colors 

## How I built it
I used SCSS and HTML to build it

## Challenges I ran into
A big challenge I ran into is the implication of shader animation. The fact that you need to apply animation to every single little shader is just labor intensive but I managed to do it!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The use of color, animation, and a new type of Css (SCSS)

## What I learned
I learned how to apply animation using SCSS and the use of color

## What's next for Spooky Spooky Ghost
I plan to make it interactive, or a game that the user controls!
